# Ruby-tictactoe
Working version of tictactoe in Ruby 
Humans:
 
 How do we see Tic Tac Toe?
  
  The board has 9 empty squares
  
  There are 2 pieces of tokens — X and O
  
  There are only 2 players
  
  How do we play Tic Tac Toe?
  
  Players take turns playing
  
  1st turn — Player 1
  
  Player 1 places their token (X) in only 1 square of their choice
  
  2nd turn — Player 2
  
  Player 2 places their token (O) in only 1 square of their choice, except they can’t touch the square that Player 1’s token already fills
  
  3rd turn- Player 1 …. and the cycle continues until a player wins or there’s a tie game
 
  There are 8 winning combinations: Top row, Middle row, Bottom row, Left column, Middle column, Right column, Left diagonal, and Right diagonal
  
  There’s a draw/tie when the entire board is filled with X’s and O’s but no winning combinations can be found
